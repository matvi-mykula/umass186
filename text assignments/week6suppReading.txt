GRAPH(discrete mathematics)
	graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense related
	vertices/nodes/points - related pair of vertices is called an edge, a connection between two elements
	edge is also called a link or line
	edges can be directed or undirected
	undirected means that the same relationship goes both ways between connected vertices
	directed means that the relationship is one way
TREE(graph theory)
	tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path
		connected acyclic undirected graph
	forest is undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by at most one path
		disjoint union of trees
	data structures are generally rooted trees
	rooted tree may be directed 
		out tree - directed tree all its edges point away from root
		in tree - directed tree all its edges point towards root
	cycle - non empty train in which only thee first and last vertices are equal
BINARY SEARCH TREE
	ordered or sorted binary tree
	rooted binary tree data structure with key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective nodes left subtree
	and less than the ones in its right subtree
	time complexity of operation on the binary search tree is proportional to the height of the tree
	insert delete and search takes O(log n) for n nodes
ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY
	dictionary, map,
	collection of key value pairs
