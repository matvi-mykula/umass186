Suppose A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 4, 6}. What is A ∩ B?


// ∩ represents intersection of sets
// overlap
// A∩B === {2}


// Write a method public static <E> List<E> notIn(List<E> list, Set<E> set). 
// notIn should return a list that contains the elements present in list but 
// not present in set. The original list and set must not be modified. For full c
// redit, your method must correctly use generics, and must not contain unnecessary 
// method calls or loops, even if they do not otherwise impact correctness. You may 
// assume List, Set, ArrayList, and HashSet are correctly imported from java.util. 
// You may not import other classes.

public static <E> List<E> notIn(List<E> list, Set<E> set){
    new list
    //instantiate list
    // for element in list
    if !set.contains(element) {
        list.add(element)
    }
}
