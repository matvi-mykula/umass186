/**
 * A simplified document indexer and search engine.
 * 
 * Documents are added to the engine one-by-one, and uniquely identified by a
 * DocumentId.
 *
 * Documents are internally represented as "terms", which are lowercased
 * versions of each word
 * in the document.
 * 
 * Queries for terms are also made on the lowercased version of the term. Terms
 * are
 * therefore case-insensitive.
 * 
 * Lookups for documents can be done by term, and the most relevant document(s)
 * to a specific term
 * (as computed by tf-idf) can also be retrieved.
